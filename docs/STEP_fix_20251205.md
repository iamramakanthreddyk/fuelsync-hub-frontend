# STEP_fix_20251205.md â€” remove unused single-report and reading endpoints

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub follows a contract-first approach where the OpenAPI specification drives both backend and frontend implementations. `docs/FRONTEND_BACKEND_MISMATCHES.md` listed two remaining mismatches: `GET /reports/sales/{id}` and `GET /nozzle-readings/{id}`. These endpoints are not present in the backend.

## Steps Already Implemented
All contract alignment fixes up to `STEP_fix_20251204.md` have been completed. The frontend APIs generally match the spec.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed `getReport` from `src/api/reports.ts` and the related `useReport` hook.
- Removed `getReading` from `src/api/contract/readings.service.ts` and the `useReading` hook.
- Updated `FRONTEND_BACKEND_MISMATCHES.md` to note that no mismatches remain.
- Documented the cleanup in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`.
