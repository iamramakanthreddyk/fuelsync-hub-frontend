# STEP_fix_20251208.md â€” Owner dashboard data fixes

## Project Context Summary
Owner dashboard cards were rendering but no data appeared. Previous refactors removed deprecated paths, but some hooks still missed filter support and the dashboard lacked visibility of latest fuel prices.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Dashboard hooks aligned with OpenAPI (`STEP_fix_20251203.md`).
- Prisma service migration (`STEP_fix_20251207.md`).

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `dashboardApi.getTopCreditors` and related hook to forward filter params.
- Added `LatestFuelPricesCard` component showing most recent prices per fuel type.
- Integrated this card on `SummaryPage` next to the sales trend chart.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes and Features.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`.
