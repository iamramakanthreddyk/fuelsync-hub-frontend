# STEP_fix_20251206.md â€” Prisma usage audit

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses a unified PostgreSQL database with tenant isolation. The backend initially relied on `pg` queries, and Prisma was introduced in step 2.23 but adoption is partial. Most services and controllers still use raw SQL.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Migration to Prisma ORM (`STEP_2_23_COMMAND.md` and later controllers).
- Recent fixes up to `STEP_fix_20251205.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Reviewed all service and controller files under `fuelsync/src/`.
- Identified areas where Prisma is used inefficiently or bypassed entirely with raw SQL.
- Documented the findings and recommendations in `docs/PRISMA_EFFICIENCY_REVIEW.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under "Technical".
- Append row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise the audit in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
