# PRISMA_EFFICIENCY_REVIEW.md â€” Service and Controller Scan

The following summary captures areas where Prisma is used inefficiently or raw SQL remains in place.

## Raw SQL via `pg` Pool
Many services still execute SQL strings directly using the `pg` client. Examples include:

- `src/services/user.service.ts` uses `client.query` to insert users and list users.
- `src/services/pump.service.ts` builds dynamic SQL for listing pumps.
- `src/services/nozzleReading.service.ts` performs complex transactions with manual SQL.
- Controllers such as `src/controllers/analytics.controller.ts` issue multiple `db.query` calls for counts.

These queries bypass Prisma's type-safe API and require manual parsing via `parseDb` utilities.

## `prisma.$queryRaw` Usage
Some newer services rely on `prisma.$queryRaw` with interpolated SQL, for example in `analytics.service.ts` and `alertRules.service.ts`. While functional, these raw queries sacrifice Prisma's optimisations and safety.

## Missing Types
Return types are often inferred as `any` or loosely typed objects. Migrating to Prisma's generated types (e.g. `Prisma.UserCreateInput`) would improve maintainability.

## Inefficient Lookups
Several queries join multiple tables per request. With Prisma, relations can be expressed via `include` or `select`, reducing boilerplate and enabling query optimisation. For instance, `alertRules.service.ts` joins pumps and nozzle readings to detect inactivity.

## Recommendations
1. Replace `pg` client usage with Prisma methods such as `prisma.user.create`, `prisma.pump.findMany`, etc.
2. Use `prisma.$transaction` for multi-step operations instead of manual `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` statements.
3. Refactor `$queryRaw` queries into Prisma aggregations (`groupBy`, `count`) where possible.
4. Leverage generated TypeScript types for inputs and results to avoid `any` casting and improve IDE support.

Adopting these patterns will ensure consistent, performant database access across the codebase.

## Implemented Improvements
- `user.service.ts` now uses `prisma.user.create` and `prisma.user.findMany` with generated types.
- `pump.service.ts` refactored to `prisma.pump` operations and `include` counts for nozzles.
- `nozzleReading.service.ts` rewritten using `prisma.$transaction` for atomic inserts and validations.
- `analytics.controller.ts` metrics are computed via Prisma aggregate queries rather than manual counts.
- `analytics.service.ts` dashboard queries switched to Prisma and typed results.

These changes remove remaining raw SQL and leverage Prisma's optimised query builder.
