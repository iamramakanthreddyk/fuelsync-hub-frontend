# STEP_fix_20250823.md â€” Test Tenant Helpers Public Schema

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub now stores all tenant data in shared public tables keyed by `tenant_id`.
Previous tests utilities still referenced per-tenant schema creation. Recent fixes
moved seeding scripts to operate only on the unified schema.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Setup scripts updated for unified schema (`STEP_fix_20250822.md`).

## What Was Done Now
- Rewrote `tests/utils/testTenant.ts` to insert tenants and users directly into
  `public.tenants` and `public.users` and return their ids.
- Ensured all test helpers rely solely on the public schema and `tenant_id` columns.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
