# STEP_fix_20250826.md â€” Unified Schema Cleanup

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses a unified database schema keyed by `tenant_id`. Older files still referenced the former `schemaName` field and migrations were scattered across multiple SQL files.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema defined in `004_complete_unified_schema.sql` and Prisma setup.
- Documentation updates through `STEP_fix_20250825.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Consolidated migrations into a single `005_master_unified_schema.sql` file and updated the apply script.
- Removed `schemaName` usage from middleware, controllers and type definitions.
- Simplified the `/schemas` debug endpoint to list public tables only.
- Updated the OpenAPI spec to drop `schemaName` fields.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
