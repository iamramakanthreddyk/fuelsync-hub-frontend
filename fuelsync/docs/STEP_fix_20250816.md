# STEP_fix_20250816.md â€” Plan Enforcement Tenant Queries

## Project Context Summary
Plan limit enforcement middleware still referenced tenant schemas for count queries. Now that all data lives in unified public tables, these checks must operate via `tenant_id`.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration and tenant service fixes up to `STEP_2_36_COMMAND.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `fetchPlanId` to look up plans by tenant ID.
- Replaced schema-based COUNT queries with `tenant_id` filters.
- Adjusted service calls to pass tenant IDs to plan enforcement helpers.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
