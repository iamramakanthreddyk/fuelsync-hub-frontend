# STEP_fix_20250907.md â€” DB migration docs cleanup

## Project Context Summary
Users were unsure which SQL file is applied by `npm run setup-unified-db` and how to handle future schema changes. Some legacy scripts also remained in the repository.

## Steps Already Implemented
Up to `STEP_fix_20250906.md` the unified schema and seed workflow were established.

## What Was Done Now
- Documented in `UNIFIED_DB_SETUP.md` that the command loads `005_master_unified_schema.sql`.
- Expanded `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` with instructions for adding new migration files.
- Updated `db_brain.md` to reference the master migration and use `setup-unified-db`.
- Removed outdated scripts `setup-database.js` and `check-db-connection.ts`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
