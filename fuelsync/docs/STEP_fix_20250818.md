# STEP_fix_20250818.md â€” Remove schemaName from docs

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub migrated to a unified database schema keyed by `tenant_id`. Older documentation and API examples still reference a `schemaName` property for tenants. The OpenAPI spec and guides must be cleaned up to avoid confusion.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migrations and service updates through `STEP_fix_20250817.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed `schemaName` fields from tenant request/response examples and frontend snippets.
- Updated SuperAdmin implementation guide to drop per-tenant schema references.
- Ensured `openapi.yaml` models no longer mention `schemaName`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
