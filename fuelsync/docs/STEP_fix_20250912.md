# STEP_fix_20250912.md â€” setTenantContext tenantId resolution

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub operates on a unified `public` schema with tenant data separated by a `tenant_id` column. The `setTenantContext` middleware should ensure each request carries a valid tenant ID. Previous refactoring left this middleware mostly empty, causing confusion about its purpose and failing to populate tenant context for super admin requests.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250911.md` are complete, including fuel price field alignment.

## What Was Done Now
- Reimplemented `setTenantContext` to populate `req.user.tenantId` from the `x-tenant-id` header when absent in the JWT.
- Added validation that returns a `TENANT_REQUIRED` error if no tenant context can be resolved.
- Updated security documentation to clarify the middleware's role.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
