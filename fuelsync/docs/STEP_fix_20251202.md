# STEP_fix_20251202.md â€” Align frontend hooks with OpenAPI data keys

## Project Context Summary
Backend responses follow the `{ success, data }` structure per `docs/openapi.yaml`. Some
API hooks still referenced nested keys like `stations` or `inventory`, relying on fallback
logic.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated all API services to extract results exclusively from the `data` field.
- Removed legacy fallback keys in stations, inventory and related APIs.
- Simplified pumps and sales services to expect OpenAPI responses.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added changelog entry under Fixes.
- Recorded this fix in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
