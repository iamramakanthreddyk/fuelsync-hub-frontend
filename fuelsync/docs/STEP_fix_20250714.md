# STEP_fix_20250714.md â€” Reports Controller Compile Fix

## Project Context Summary
The backend compilation failed after introducing new analytics and report endpoints. TypeScript threw `TS1128` in `reports.controller.ts` due to an extra closing bracket left over from refactoring.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend features up to `STEP_2_20_COMMAND.md` and fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250713.md` are complete.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed the stray closing brace in `src/controllers/reports.controller.ts` that prematurely ended the `createReportsHandlers` function.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md` noting the compile error fix.
- Update `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` under fixes.
- Append a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for this step.
