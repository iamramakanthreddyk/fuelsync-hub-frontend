# STEP_fix_20250914.md â€” Explicit updated_at on inserts

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub runs a unified Postgres schema where every table defines a non-null `updated_at` column. Some service methods relied on database defaults which were missing in certain environments, causing `null value in column "updated_at"` errors when creating records.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250913.md` are complete, covering tenant metrics and middleware improvements.

## What Was Done Now
- Reviewed all service-layer INSERT statements.
- Added `updated_at` columns with `NOW()` values to creation queries across creditors, fuel prices, stations, pumps, nozzles, deliveries, nozzle readings, sales, plan creation, fuel inventory seeding and alerts.
- Updated tenant settings upsert and day reconciliation inserts to set `updated_at`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
