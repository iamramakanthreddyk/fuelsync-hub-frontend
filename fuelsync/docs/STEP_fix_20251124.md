# STEP_fix_20251124.md â€” Extended JWT lifetime

## Project Context Summary
Existing authentication docs referenced a one-hour JWT expiry, but the implementation used a month-long token. Long running tests still occasionally failed due to expiration.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` constant to `100y` for effectively non-expiring tokens.
- All journey guides and AUTH documentation now reference the extended lifetime.
- Phase summary and changelog entries recorded this change.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 2 summary addition.
