# STEP_fix_20250712.md — Remove Legacy Seeders

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub has gone through multiple seeding approaches. The repository still contained old seed scripts and an HTTP `/migrate` endpoint that populated extensive demo data. This caused confusion and unexpected records when creating tenants.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` up to the 2025‑07‑11 fix.

## What Was Done Now
- Deleted unused seed scripts and `src/utils/seedUtils.ts`.
- Removed the `/migrate` endpoint from `src/app.ts`.
- Updated `init-db.js` and `run-all-tests.js` to call `npm run setup-db`.
- Revised docs to reference the setup script instead of removed seeders.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append CHANGELOG entry detailing the cleanup.
- Update `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` with this fix.
- Add row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
