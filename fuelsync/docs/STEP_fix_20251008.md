# STEP_fix_20251008.md â€” Azure unified setup script

## Project Context Summary
Azure deployments needed a single command to apply the unified schema and seed demo data. Running several scripts manually was error prone.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `scripts/setup-azure-db.js` which orchestrates schema setup, migrations, the cash reports workaround, and seeding.
- Introduced npm script `setup-azure-db` to run it easily.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes
- Implementation index row
- Phase 1 summary bullet
