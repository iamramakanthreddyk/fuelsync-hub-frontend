# STEP_fix_20250827.md â€” SQL String Literal Fixes

## Project Context Summary
The TypeScript build failed because some service queries used single-quoted strings across multiple lines.
JavaScript does not allow newline characters inside single-quoted strings, causing `tsc` errors.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema cleanup up to `STEP_fix_20250826.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Replaced multi-line single-quoted SQL queries with template strings in
  `src/services/creditor.service.ts` and `src/services/fuelPrice.service.ts`.
- Verified compilation succeeds with `npm run build`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
