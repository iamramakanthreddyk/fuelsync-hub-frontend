# STEP_fix_20250911.md â€” Fuel price validFrom alignment

## Project Context Summary
The API and database schema use the `valid_from` column for fuel price records. However,
backend validators and services referenced `effectiveFrom`, leading to inconsistent payloads
and validation errors.

## Steps Already Implemented
Up to `STEP_fix_20250910.md` the backend handled CRUD operations for fuel prices but used
the outdated `effectiveFrom` field.

## What Was Done Now
- Renamed `effectiveFrom` to `validFrom` in `FuelPriceInput` and related validators.
- Updated controller and service logic to write `valid_from` in the database.
- Adjusted helper utilities and swagger docs to expose `validFrom`.
- Updated integration docs to show the new field name.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
