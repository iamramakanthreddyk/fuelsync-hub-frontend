# STEP_fix_20250705.md â€” Simplify Seeding Scripts

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub previously shipped many seed scripts for demo and test environments which caused confusion. Only a single production seeder is really needed.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Full database schema and utilities completed in Phase 1.
- Recent fixes updated test database provisioning and UUID handling.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed all seed scripts except `scripts/seed-production.ts`.
- Updated npm scripts and Jest setup to drop references to the deleted files.
- Rewrote documentation with three clear steps: connect to PostgreSQL, create the schema, run the production seeder.
- Added troubleshooting guidance for seeding failures.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `SEEDING.md`, `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md`, `SERVER_README.md`, and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` revised.
- Added this fix to `CHANGELOG.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`, and noted in `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`.
