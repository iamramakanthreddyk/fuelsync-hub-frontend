# STEP_fix_20250824.md â€” Documentation Cleanup for Unified Schema

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub migrated to a unified schema keyed solely by `tenant_id`. Some docs still referenced the old `schema_name` field which no longer exists.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration and previous documentation fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250823.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed or marked deprecated `schema_name` examples in developer guides.
- Added notes about the unified schema refactor in summary and changelog files.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
