# STEP_fix_20250817.md — Service Schema Cleanup

## Project Context Summary
The unified schema migration moved all tenant data into shared `public` tables keyed by `tenant_id`. However, many service modules still referenced per-tenant schemas via `schema_name` variables. This prevented proper multi‑tenant isolation and conflicted with the new design.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration and plan enforcement fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250816.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Audited `src/services` and updated modules using `schema_name` to query unified tables with `tenant_id` filters.
- Removed `createTenantUser` and seeding helpers reliance on schema names.
- Updated affected controllers to pass tenant IDs.
- Adjusted seeding utilities to insert data directly into `public` tables.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
