# STEP_fix_20250704.md â€” Test DB UUID & Jest Cleanup

## Project Context Summary
Jest tests were failing because `scripts/create-test-db.ts` inserted into
`public.plans` without supplying an `id`. The migration requires a UUID, so the
insert triggered a NOT NULL violation. Some unit tests also expected outdated
return structures.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Fix 2025-07-03 removed `uuid-ossp` defaults and relies on the backend to
generate IDs.
- Previous steps established local Postgres usage and test provisioning scripts.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `scripts/create-test-db.ts` to generate a UUID with `randomUUID()`
  when inserting the default `basic` plan.
- Adjusted unit tests (`tests/auth.service.test.ts` and
  `tests/creditor.service.test.ts`) to match current service outputs.
- All Jest suites now pass with a local PostgreSQL instance.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Logged this fix in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added entry to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and noted in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
