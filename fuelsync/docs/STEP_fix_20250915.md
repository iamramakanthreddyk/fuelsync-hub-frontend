# STEP_fix_20250915.md â€” Unified Sales Storage

## Project Context Summary
The `/api/v1/sales` endpoint listed records from `public.sales`, but nozzle readings
were saving sales into per-tenant tables like `tenant_id.sales`. Several dashboards
and reports also queried these tenant tables. As a result, sales listings returned
empty results even though readings existed.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250914.md`, including updated_at fields and tenant
context middleware.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `nozzleReading.service` to insert readings and generated sales directly
  into `public.nozzle_readings` and `public.sales` with `tenant_id` filters.
- Refactored reconciliation service and controller queries to read from the unified
tables.
- Updated dashboard and reports controllers to query `public.sales` and related
tables using `tenant_id` parameters.
- Ensured listing of nozzle readings filters by `tenant_id`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
