# STEP_fix_20250703.md â€” Remove uuid-ossp Defaults

## Project Context Summary
Earlier migrations still enabled the `uuid-ossp` extension and generated UUIDs in the database. The backend now creates IDs, so the extension and defaults were obsolete.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Safe schema checks and additional indexes were introduced in Step 2.14.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed `uuid-ossp` extension declaration and all `DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4()` clauses from public and tenant schema templates.
- Updated duplicate SQL templates to match.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Logged this fix in `CHANGELOG.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
