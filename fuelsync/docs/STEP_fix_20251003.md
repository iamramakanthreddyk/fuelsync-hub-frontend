# STEP_fix_20251003.md â€” Migrations use SSL

## Project Context Summary
`scripts/migrate.js` lacked SSL options, causing `npm run setup-unified-db` to fail against Azure PostgreSQL with "no pg_hba.conf entry ... no encryption".

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20251002.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to the connection pool in `scripts/migrate.js` so migrations can run on SSL-enforced databases.
- Documented the change in the changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 1 summary bullet.
