# STEP_fix_20251011.md â€” Azure README crosslinks

## Project Context Summary
Azure deployment scripts exist, but the README lacked clear instructions for developers deploying on Azure.

## What Was Done Now
- Added a "Deploying to Azure" section in `README.md` linking to `docs/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and `docs/AZURE_DEV_SETUP.md`.
- Documented the `npm run setup-azure-db` script for creating tables and seed data.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Enhancements
- Implementation index row
- Phase 1 summary bullet
