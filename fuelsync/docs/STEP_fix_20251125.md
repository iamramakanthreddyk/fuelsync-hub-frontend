# STEP_fix_20251125.md â€” Refresh token constant

## Project Context Summary
Refresh tokens were generated with inline values instead of shared constants. Using a constant clarifies policy and makes configuration easier.

## What Was Done Now
- Created `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` constant set to `24h`.
- Refresh endpoint signs tokens using `JWT_SECRET` and the new constant.
- Updated `AUTH.md` with refresh token policy.
- Logged the change in phase summary and changelog.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append changelog entry.
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
