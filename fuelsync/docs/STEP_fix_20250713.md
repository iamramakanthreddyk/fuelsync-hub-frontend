# STEP_fix_20250713.md â€” Document Frontend API Contract

## Project Context Summary
The frontend team shared an extensive OpenAPI specification (v1) describing all endpoints and schemas expected for FuelSync. The backend currently exposes fewer routes under `/api/v1`. To coordinate development, we need a document that highlights gaps between frontend expectations and the implemented backend API.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend and docs up to `STEP_fix_20250712.md` are complete. `docs/openapi.yaml` represents the backend contract.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` containing the full frontend API specification.
- Created `frontend/docs/api-diff.md` summarising endpoint differences between the frontend spec and backend implementation.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` describing the API diff docs.
- Update `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md` noting the new documentation resource.
- Add a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step.
