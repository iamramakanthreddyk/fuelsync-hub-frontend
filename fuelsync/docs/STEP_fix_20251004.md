# STEP_fix_20251004.md â€” Ensure UUID defaults in migrations

## Project Context Summary
Running the unified database setup failed during migration `003` because the
seed admin record attempted to insert without a generated ID. The migrations did
not explicitly enable the `pgcrypto` extension, so environments without it would
fail to generate UUIDs.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;` to migrations `001`, `004` and
  `005` so UUID functions are always available.
- Updated `003_unified_schema.sql` to create the extension and to insert the
  seed admin user with `gen_random_uuid()`.
- Documented this fix in the changelog, implementation index and phase summary.
