# STEP_fix_20250923.md â€” Unified setup runs migrations

## Project Context Summary
`setup-unified-db` bootstraps the database using the unified schema but previously required a separate `db:migrate` command to apply newer SQL files.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250922_COMMAND.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Modified `scripts/setup-unified-db.js` to execute `node scripts/migrate.js up` after loading `005_master_unified_schema.sql`.
- Updated `UNIFIED_DB_SETUP.md` and `db_brain.md` to note that the setup command applies any pending migrations.
- Added documentation entries in the changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 2 summary bullet.
