# STEP_fix_20250718.md â€” Schema Alignment with Business Rules

## Project Context Summary
Migration `003_unified_schema.sql` consolidated tenant tables but is missing some fields noted in `BUSINESS_RULES.md`. We need to align the migration with the rules by adding additional tables and columns.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration with referential integrity (`STEP_fix_20250717.md`)
- `db_brain.md` documenting core tables

## What Was Done Now
- Added `reading_id` column to `sales` referencing `nozzle_readings`
- Created `user_stations` table for station access checks
- Extended `fuel_prices` with `effective_to` column for history tracking
- Added `tenant_settings` table for configurable preferences
- Updated documentation (`db_brain.md`) accordingly

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append new entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Update `docs/PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` summarising this fix
- Add a row to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` linking this step
