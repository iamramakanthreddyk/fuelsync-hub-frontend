# STEP_fix_20250702.md â€” Apt Install Reminder

## Project Context Summary
Tests pass when PostgreSQL is installed locally or the Docker DB is running. Some contributors were unsure how to install Postgres quickly when Jest skipped tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
Previous fix on 2025-07-01 documented the fallback procedure if the test DB cannot be created.

## What Was Done Now
- Verified that installing PostgreSQL with `apt-get` then seeding the demo data allows all Jest suites to run.
- Added explicit `sudo apt-get` commands in README, TROUBLESHOOTING, and Phase 2 summary for clarity.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added this step to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and logged the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.
