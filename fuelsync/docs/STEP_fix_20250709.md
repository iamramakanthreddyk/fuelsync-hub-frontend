# STEP_fix_20250709.md — Align Backend with Frontend API Contract

## Project Context Summary
The docs in `docs/missing/` highlighted several gaps between the frontend expectations and the implemented backend. Key issues included a base URL mismatch, missing dashboard and analytics endpoints, absent auth utilities, and mismatched credit payment routes.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Complete backend with authentication, station management and tenant APIs.
- Prior fix on 2025‑07‑08 finalised Azure deployment configuration.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/app.ts` to serve all routes under `/api/v1`.
- Added dashboard endpoints and controller for sales summaries, payment method breakdown, fuel type breakdown, top creditors and sales trend.
- Implemented daily reconciliation summary, admin analytics, logout and refresh token endpoints.
- Realigned credit payment routes to `/credit-payments` and enhanced station listing with real counts.
- Updated OpenAPI spec and `docs/missing` analyses to reflect the new endpoints.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this fix.
- `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` updated to mention API alignment.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` appended with this step.
- `docs/missing/*` files revised to mark issues resolved.
