# STEP_fix_20250708.md â€” Final Azure Cleanup

## Project Context Summary
The project previously included Vercel deployment files and configuration. Recent commits switched deployment to Azure Web App, but remnants of the old setup remained.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Full backend implementation with Azure-compatible start scripts.
- Prior fixes moved cross-env and Node typings to dependencies for Azure builds.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed all Vercel related files and scripts.
- Updated `package.json` to drop Vercel dependencies and scripts.
- Cleaned CORS and DB utilities to reference Azure only.
- Rewrote `DEV_GUIDE.md` to focus on Azure deployment and removed Vercel sections.
- Deleted serverless entry files and Vercel docs.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` updated with this fix.
