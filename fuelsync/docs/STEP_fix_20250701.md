# STEP_fix_20250701.md — Test DB Provisioning Guidance

## Project Context Summary
Automated Jest tests create a temporary `fuelsync_test` database. Some
contributors reported tests being skipped with "unable to provision test DB" when
PostgreSQL was not installed or the Docker container wasn't running.

## Steps Already Implemented
Phase 2 is complete and earlier fixes added local install notes and Docker
troubleshooting up to 2025‑06‑27.

## What Was Done Now
- Documented fallback instructions in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md`
  and `README.md` explaining how to install/start PostgreSQL when tests cannot
  create the database.
- Added a note in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` near the test verification section.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Logged this fix in `CHANGELOG.md` and added a row to
  `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
