# STEP_fix_20251001.md â€” Migration runner conflict handling

## Project Context Summary
The setup script applies a master schema and then runs all SQL migration files. Migrations `006` onward already insert their version into `schema_migrations`. The runner also inserted the same version, leading to a unique constraint error.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250923.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Modified `scripts/migrate.js` to insert migration records with `ON CONFLICT (version) DO NOTHING`.
- Documented the change in the changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 1 summary bullet.
