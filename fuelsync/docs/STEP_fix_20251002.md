# STEP_fix_20251002.md â€” Local DB and migration fix

## Project Context Summary
Running migrations in the Codex environment failed because no local database was configured.
Using the customer's connection strings caused authentication errors.
While setting up a local PostgreSQL server we found that `003_unified_schema.sql` referenced tables before they were created.

## What Was Done Now
- Installed PostgreSQL locally and created a `fuelsync` database for automated tests.
- Updated `scripts/migrate.js` to load environment variables via `dotenv`.
- Corrected the ordering in `003_unified_schema.sql` so all eight migrations execute.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added a changelog entry.
- Logged this fix in the implementation index.
- Marked the step done in `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`.
