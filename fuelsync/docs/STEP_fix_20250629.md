# STEP_fix_20250629.md â€” Plan ID mapping for enforcement

## Project Context Summary
Plan limit enforcement always fell back to the starter rules because `getPlanRules` expected string keys like `starter`, but plans are seeded with UUIDs. Demo tenants therefore hit limits prematurely.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Middleware helpers in `planEnforcement.ts` enforce limits on creation.
- Seed script provisions three plans with fixed UUIDs.
- Previous fix updated login tests and schema ordering.

## What Was Done Now
1. Mapped seeded plan UUIDs to rule presets in `planConfig.ts`.
2. Added unit tests (`tests/planEnforcement.test.ts`) validating pump creation limits.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append changelog entry.
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` with this fix.
