# STEP_fix_20250715.md â€” Plan Enforcement Schema Lookup Fix

## Project Context Summary
Owners encountered `invalid input syntax for type uuid` errors when creating stations. Plan enforcement middleware expected a tenant UUID but received the schema name.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend features and fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250714.md` are complete.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/middleware/planEnforcement.ts` to look up plan information using `schema_name` instead of tenant UUID.
- All enforcement functions now accept a schema name and query tenant data accordingly.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add a fix entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Update `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` to mention schema based plan enforcement.
- Append a row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for this fix.
