# STEP_2_26_COMMAND.md â€” OpenAPI Audit and Endpoint Verification

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub now uses a mix of raw SQL and Prisma ORM. Step 2.25 created an inventory of all endpoints and regenerated `openapi.yaml` from the route files.

## Steps Already Implemented
- User and several CRUD controllers migrated to Prisma (`STEP_2_23_COMMAND.md`, `STEP_2_24_COMMAND.md`).
- Full endpoint table and autogenerated spec committed in `STEP_2_25_COMMAND.md`.

## What to Build Now
1. Parse all route files and `app.ts` to verify every API path and method.
2. Compare this list to `docs/openapi.yaml` and report any differences.
3. Document the audit results in `backend_brain.md` including notes on contract drift or missing schemas.
4. Update changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Files To Update
- `backend_brain.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
