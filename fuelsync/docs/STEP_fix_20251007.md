# STEP_fix_20251007.md â€” Azure cash_reports migration

## Project Context Summary
Azure Citus cannot enforce foreign keys referencing distributed tables. Migration `007_create_cash_reports.sql` fails on Azure with `foreign key constraint ... cannot be implemented` when run via the standard migration script.

## What Was Done Now
 - Added `scripts/apply-cash-reports-azure.js` which reads the migration, removes the FK references, and executes it against Azure. Added npm script `azure-migrate-cash` for easier runs.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes
- Implementation index row
- Phase 1 summary bullet
