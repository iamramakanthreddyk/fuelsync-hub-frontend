# STEP_fix_20250820.md â€” Remove Tenant Schema Artifacts

## Project Context Summary
Unified schema has replaced per-tenant schemas. Some utility scripts and tests still referenced
`schema_name` or created separate schemas for tenants. These remnants caused confusion and were
no longer used by the application.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration and service cleanup up to `STEP_fix_20250819.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed the `createTenantSchema` logic from `migrate.js` and corresponding CLI option.
- Updated `init-test-db.js` and `reset-passwords.ts` to use public tables and tenant IDs.
- Dropped schema creation steps from Jest setup utilities.
- Replaced obsolete npm scripts and updated documentation in `AGENTS.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
