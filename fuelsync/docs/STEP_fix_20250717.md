# STEP_fix_20250717.md â€” Migration Documentation Adjustments

## Project Context Summary
The unified schema migration (003_unified_schema.sql) lacked definitions for `admin_users` and `schema_migrations` tables and did not enforce foreign key references on `tenant_id`. Some docs also missed these details.

## Steps Already Implemented
- 003_unified_schema.sql created tenant tables in `public`
- `db_brain.md` documented the schema overview

## What Was Done Now
- Added `schema_migrations` and `admin_users` table definitions for completeness
- Enforced `REFERENCES public.tenants(id)` on all mandatory `tenant_id` columns
- Added table comments for self-documentation
- Updated `db_brain.md` with referential integrity note

## Required Documentation Updates
- New CHANGELOG entry describing the migration enhancements
- Update `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` with this fix
- Append a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
