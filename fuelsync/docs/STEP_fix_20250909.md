# STEP_fix_20250909.md â€” Prisma DB URL fallback

## Project Context Summary
Prisma is used for several backend controllers. Deployments on Azure use
`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER` and related variables instead of a single `DATABASE_URL`.
When this variable is missing Prisma fails with `Environment variable not found`.

## Steps Already Implemented
Up to `STEP_fix_20250908.md` all services rely on these `DB_*` variables and
load `.env.development` or `.env.test` files during startup.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/utils/prisma.ts` to load the same env file as the pg pool helper.
- If `DATABASE_URL` is not provided, the script now constructs it from
  `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_NAME`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
