# STEP_fix_20251121.md â€” Pump column rename

## Project Context Summary
Backend services and Prisma schema reference a `name` field on pumps, but the underlying database column remained `label`, leading to runtime errors.

## What Was Done Now
- Added migration `009_rename_pumps_label_to_name.sql` to rename the column.
- Updated schema changelog and documentation to reflect the change.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 1 summary update.
