# STEP_fix_20251101.md â€” Fuel inventory timestamp fix

## Project Context Summary
Seeding fuel inventory records failed because `createFuelInventoryTable` did not
include an `updated_at` column even though the seed script inserts into it.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to the table definition in
  `src/services/fuelInventory.service.ts` so runtime table creation matches the
  unified schema and seed logic.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes
- Implementation index row
- Phase 2 summary bullet
