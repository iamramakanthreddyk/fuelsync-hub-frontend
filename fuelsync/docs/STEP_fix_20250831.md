# STEP_fix_20250831.md — Consistent DB Password Variable

## Project Context Summary
In different environments the database password variable was referenced as
`DB_PASS` or `DB_PASSWORD`. This inconsistency caused confusion when starting
the app or running tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend services use `process.env.DB_PASSWORD` as of `STEP_fix_20250830.md`.
However development and test `.env` files, Docker compose config and Jest
helpers still relied on `DB_PASS`.

## What Was Done Now
- Renamed `DB_PASS` to `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env.development`, `.env.test` and
  `docker-compose.yml`.
- Updated Jest setup scripts and test utilities to read `DB_PASSWORD`.
- Verified no remaining uses of the old variable in the codebase.
# STEP_fix_20250831.md — Default 404 Handler

## Project Context Summary
All API endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1` and return errors via the `errorResponse` utility. However, requests to undefined routes currently return Express's default HTML 404 page instead of the JSON error structure.

## Steps Already Implemented
Admin login route and UUID fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250830.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Added a catch-all middleware in `src/app.ts` that returns `errorResponse(res, 404, 'Route not found')`.
- Documented the new `NotFound` response component in `docs/openapi.yaml`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
