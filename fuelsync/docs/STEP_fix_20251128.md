# STEP_fix_20251128.md â€” Previous reading in nozzle list

## Project Context Summary
The `GET /api/v1/nozzle-readings` endpoint only returned the raw reading value and timestamp.
Clients want to see the previous reading for each entry without calling the daily summary API.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `listNozzleReadings` query to compute `previous_reading` using `LAG` over all records and filter afterwards.
- Extended the `NozzleReading` schema in `openapi.yaml` with the `previousReading` property.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Append row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
