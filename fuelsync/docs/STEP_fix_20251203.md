# STEP_fix_20251203.md â€” Remove deprecated dashboard API usage

## Project Context Summary
OpenAPI `docs/openapi.yaml` marks `/dashboard/fuel-types` and `/dashboard/daily-trend` as deprecated.
Frontend services and components still referenced these old paths and response fields.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/api/dashboard.ts` to call `/dashboard/fuel-breakdown` and `/dashboard/sales-trend`.
- Synced `api-contract.ts` types with OpenAPI for dashboard data.
- Adjusted dashboard charts and cards to use new response property names.
- Updated `SalesReportSummary` helpers for renamed fields.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added changelog entry under Fixes.
- Appended row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and noted in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`.
