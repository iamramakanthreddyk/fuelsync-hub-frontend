# QA_AUDIT_REPORT.md — Final Full-Stack QA Audit

This report verifies alignment between the OpenAPI specification, backend controllers and frontend usage for the major operational flows.

## API Contract Audit

| Domain | Endpoint | Backend Route | Frontend Hook | Component Usage | Response Match |
|-------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Readings | `POST /api/v1/nozzle-readings` | `nozzleReading.route.ts` | `useCreateReading` | `ReadingEntryForm.tsx` | ✅ |
| Reconciliation | `POST /api/v1/reconciliation` | `reconciliation.route.ts` | `useCreateReconciliation` | `ReconciliationForm.tsx` | ✅ |
| Inventory | `GET /api/v1/inventory/alerts` | `inventory.route.ts` | `useInventoryAlerts` | `InventoryPage.tsx` | ✅ |
| Dashboard | `GET /api/v1/dashboard/station-metrics` | `dashboard.route.ts` | `useStationMetrics` | `StationMetricsList.tsx` | ✅ |
| Settings | `GET /api/v1/tenant/settings` | `settings.route.ts` | `useFeatureFlags` | `SalesPage.tsx` | ✅ |

All inspected endpoints exist in the backend, are exposed via React Query hooks and used in pages/components. Responses use the `{ data }` wrapper defined in the spec.

## Functional Flow Validation

- **Reading ➜ Sale**: `ReadingEntryForm` calls `useCreateReading`, which posts to `/nozzle-readings` and triggers auto-sale logic in the backend.
- **Reconciliation**: `ReconciliationPage` loads daily summaries and creates records via `useCreateReconciliation`.
- **Inventory Alert**: `useInventoryAlerts` fetches `/inventory/alerts`, displaying warnings on `InventoryPage` when stock is low.
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Dashboard pages consume hooks (`useStationMetrics`, etc.) that map to `/dashboard/*` routes for analytics.
- **Settings**: `useFeatureFlags` loads tenant flags from `/tenant/settings` to toggle UI features.

No broken flows were identified during static analysis.

## Best Practice Review

- React Query hooks follow `useX` naming and invalidate queries on mutations.
- Backend routes use middleware for authentication and role checks.
- Prisma client is used across services after the latest migration cleanup.
- OpenAPI specification is versioned at `/api/v1` and matches controller responses.

Overall the system appears production-ready with frontend and backend in sync.
