# STEP_fix_20250814.md â€” Login Query Updates

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub recently migrated to a unified database schema which removed the `schema_name` column from the `tenants` table. The authentication logic still referenced this column, leading to runtime errors during login.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration and previous fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250813.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `auth.controller.ts` to look up tenants by UUID and removed references to `schema_name`.
- Updated `auth.service.ts` queries accordingly.
- Documented the fix in `CHANGELOG.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise changes in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
