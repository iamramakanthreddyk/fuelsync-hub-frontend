# STEP_fix_20250920.md â€” Daily summary price lookup

## Project Context Summary
The daily summary endpoint must provide accurate delta and sales data for each nozzle. A previous fix added support for using the prior day's reading, but the price lookup did not consider the reading timestamp and rows with a single reading were still filtered out.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250921.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `getDailySummary` query to compute `previous_reading` over all nozzle readings and filter by date afterwards.
- Replaced the direct join to `fuel_prices` with a LEFT JOIN LATERAL that selects the price record valid at the reading time.
- Removed the `previous_reading IS NOT NULL` filter so nozzles with a single reading are returned.
- Documented query parameters and response schema in `openapi.yaml`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Updated `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
- Appended row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step file.
