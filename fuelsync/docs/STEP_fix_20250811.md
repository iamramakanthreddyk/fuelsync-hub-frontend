# STEP_fix_20250811.md â€” Consolidate Migration Scripts

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses a unified database schema defined in `migrations/schema/003_unified_schema.sql`.
Several incremental SQL files were added over time for indexes and columns. The
migrations folder now contains legacy templates and additive scripts which cause
confusion when resetting the database.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration with tables and constraints (`STEP_fix_20250719.md`)
- Removal of obsolete production migrations (`STEP_fix_20250720.md`)

## What Was Done Now
- Merged all remaining incremental migrations into `migrations/schema/003_unified_schema.sql`.
  - Added yearly pricing column to `plans`.
  - Added `deleted_at` to `tenants` with index.
  - Added `name` column for `admin_users`.
  - Included `report_schedules` table and additional indexes.
- Deleted unused scripts: `migrations/003_add_indexes.sql`,
  `migrations/004_add_additional_indexes.sql`,
  `migrations/005_add_price_yearly_to_plans.sql`,
  `migrations/006_add_deleted_at_to_tenants.sql`,
  `migrations/007_add_name_to_admin_users.sql`,
  `migrations/001_create_public_schema.sql`,
  `migrations/tenant_schema_template.sql`,
  `migrations/schema/002_tenant_schema_template.sql`,
  `migrations/schema/004_add_report_schedules.sql`.
- Updated `db_brain.md` to reference the single unified migration and removed the
  incremental step.
- Documented the cleanup in `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and
  `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry for the consolidated migration.
- Append fix summary in `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`.
- Insert a new row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this fix.
