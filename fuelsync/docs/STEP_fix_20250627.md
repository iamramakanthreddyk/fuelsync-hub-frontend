# STEP_fix_20250627.md â€” Unified Schema Setup Scripts

## Project Context Summary
Prior migration steps consolidated the multi-tenant schemas into a single unified schema. However, no automated process existed to apply this migration and seed data in new environments. The latest commits introduced Prisma-based scripts but documentation was missing and migration instructions were unclear.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema defined in `004_complete_unified_schema.sql`.
- Prisma schema aligned with the database (`prisma/schema.prisma`).

## What Was Done Now
- Added helper scripts:
  - `scripts/apply-unified-schema.js` applies the unified migration.
  - `scripts/fix-constraints.js` drops legacy tenant constraints.
  - `scripts/verify-schema.js` validates the schema after migration.
  - `scripts/seed-data.js` seeds default plans and demo data via Prisma.
  - `scripts/setup-unified-db.js` orchestrates all steps including `npx prisma generate`.
- Documented the full process in `UNIFIED_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.md`, `UNIFIED_DB_SETUP.md` and `SEED_DATA_GUIDE.md`.
- Updated `package.json` with `db:*` script aliases for the above tasks.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append a feature entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Update `docs/PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` summarising this unified setup.
- Add a row to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step.
