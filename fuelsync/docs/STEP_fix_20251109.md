# STEP_fix_20251109.md â€” Frontend documentation flow fix

## Project Context Summary
Review feedback indicated that the frontend reference guide still suggested that updates could originate from the frontend. The team needs an authoritative flow starting from the database.

## What Was Done Now
- Replaced the update section in `FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` with the correct schema change propagation flow.
- Emphasized consulting `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` and `backend_brain.md` before frontend work.
- Added an addendum in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md` summarizing this clarified process.
- Logged the fix in the changelog and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
