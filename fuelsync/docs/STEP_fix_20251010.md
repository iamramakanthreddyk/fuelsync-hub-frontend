# STEP_fix_20251010.md — Azure tenant_settings_kv migration

## Project Context Summary
Azure deployments cannot enforce foreign keys referencing distributed tables. Migration `008_create_tenant_settings_kv.sql` fails on Azure due to `REFERENCES public.tenants(id)`.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `scripts/apply-tenant-settings-kv-azure.js` which reads migration 008, strips the FK reference and executes it with SSL.
- Updated `setup-azure-db.js` to exclude `008_create_tenant_settings_kv.sql` during Step 4 and to run the new script after the cash reports workaround.
- Added npm script `azure-migrate-settings` for manual execution.
