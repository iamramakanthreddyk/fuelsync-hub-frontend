# STEP_fix_20250921.md â€” Daily summary previous-day readings

## Project Context Summary
Some stations record only one nozzle reading per day. The `getDailySummary` query filtered by date inside the CTE, so `LAG` could not access the prior day's reading, causing those nozzles to be omitted.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250920.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Modified `getDailySummary` to compute `LAG` across all readings and filter by date after the fact.
- OpenAPI documentation updated with `stationId` and `date` query parameters.
- Implementation guide snippet updated to show the new query.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added fix entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Appended row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and summary in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
