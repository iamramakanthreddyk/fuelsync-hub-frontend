# STEP_fix_20251009.md â€” Skip cash_reports migration in Azure setup

## Project Context Summary
The unified Azure setup script used the standard migration runner which attempted to apply migration `007_create_cash_reports.sql`. On Azure this fails because of unsupported foreign keys. The previous fix provided `apply-cash-reports-azure.js`, but `setup-azure-db.js` still executed migration 007 before the workaround.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `setup-azure-db.js` to use `MigrationRunner` and run migrations individually.
- Filtered out `007_create_cash_reports.sql` so it is skipped during Step 4.
- Step 5 still runs `apply-cash-reports-azure.js` to create the table without foreign keys.
