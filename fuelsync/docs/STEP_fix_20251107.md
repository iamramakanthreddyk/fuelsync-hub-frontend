# STEP_fix_20251107.md â€” Relocate column update workflow

## Project Context Summary
`FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` temporarily included database column change
instructions. Reviewers requested that these belong in the database docs.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed the column update section from `FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` and added
  a pointer to `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md`.
- Documented the full column-change workflow in `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md`.
- Updated `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md` to note the new doc location.
- Logged this fix in `CHANGELOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
