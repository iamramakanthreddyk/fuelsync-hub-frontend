# STEP_fix_20250829.md â€” Comprehensive UUID Insertion

## Project Context Summary
Azure PostgreSQL instances block extensions like `uuid-ossp`. Although the master unified schema sets default UUID generation using `gen_random_uuid()`, Azure restricts using these defaults. Previous fixes moved some ID generation into the backend, but several service methods still relied on database defaults.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Backend-side UUID generation for tenants, plans and admin users (`STEP_fix_20250828.md`).

## What Was Done Now
- Reviewed all service files for `INSERT` statements.
- Added `crypto.randomUUID()` where IDs were previously omitted, covering pumps, stations, nozzles, users, creditors, credit payments, fuel deliveries, fuel prices, alerts, nozzle readings, sales and day reconciliations.
- Updated tenant creation helpers to assign IDs to owner, manager and attendant accounts.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
