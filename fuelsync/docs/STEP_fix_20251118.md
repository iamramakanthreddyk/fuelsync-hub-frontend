# STEP_fix_20251118.md â€” Nozzle validator type casting

## Project Context Summary
Running `npm run build` after the pump name refactor produced a type error in `validateCreateNozzle`. The `fuelType` property was typed as `string`, conflicting with the stricter union in `NozzleInput`.

## What Was Done Now
- Cast `fuelType` to `'petrol' | 'diesel' | 'premium'` when constructing the result object.
- Verified that `npm run build` completes without errors.
- Logged this fix in the changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise fix in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
