# STEP_fix_20250622.md â€” Local Dev Setup and Seed Fixes

## Project Context
FuelSync Hub backend with automated test DB was completed. Running the API locally required manual PostgreSQL installation and seeding scripts needed tweaks.

## What Was Done
- Installed PostgreSQL locally and created `fuelsync_hub` database
- Updated seed scripts to use hashed passwords and safe upserts
- Removed optional `location` column from station services
- Added `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` documenting steps to run DB, seed data and start the server
