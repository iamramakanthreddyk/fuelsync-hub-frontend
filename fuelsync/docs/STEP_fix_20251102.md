# STEP_fix_20251102.md â€” Fuel delivery and inventory enum corrections

## Project Context Summary
The OpenAPI specification lagged behind recent database migrations. Fuel deliveries should reference a `supplier` field and allow a `premium` fuel type. Inventory records also store tank `capacity`.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `docs/openapi.yaml` and `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` to include `capacity` in `FuelInventory`, rename `deliveredBy` to `supplier`, and extend all `fuelType` enums with `premium`.
- Modified `src/docs/swagger.ts` to mirror these schema changes.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Append a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
