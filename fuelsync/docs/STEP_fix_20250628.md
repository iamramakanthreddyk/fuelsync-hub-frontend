# STEP_fix_20250628.md â€” Login Tests & Schema Patch

## Project Context Summary
Earlier migration scripts failed on fresh databases and the login test used outdated credentials. This blocked verification of API functionality in clean environments.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified database setup scripts (`setup-unified-db.js`, `apply-unified-schema.js`).
- Seeding scripts for demo data.

## What Was Done Now
1. Fixed `003_unified_schema.sql` to skip dropping `pg_toast`.
2. Reordered table creation in `005_master_unified_schema.sql` so foreign keys resolve.
3. Updated `scripts/simple-login-test.js` with seeded credentials and configurable port.
4. Validated database setup and login flow locally.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add entry in `CHANGELOG.md` under Fixes.
- Append summary in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
- Add row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
