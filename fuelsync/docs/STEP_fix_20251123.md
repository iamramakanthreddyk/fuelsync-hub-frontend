# STEP_fix_20251123.md — Cash report credit entries

## Project Context Summary
The `/api/v1/attendant/cash-report` endpoint only accepted `cashAmount` and a single `creditAmount` value. Attendants often mis‑typed the credit total which caused reconciliation mismatches. Credit sales were not logged individually.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated the cash report payload to accept a `creditEntries` array with `creditorId`, `fuelType` and optional `litres` or `amount`.
- Controller and service now create sales rows for each credit entry and compute the total credit amount automatically.
- OpenAPI specification, backend brain and docs updated accordingly.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Append row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Mark fix in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
