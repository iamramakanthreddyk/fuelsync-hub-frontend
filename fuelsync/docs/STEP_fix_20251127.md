# STEP_fix_20251127.md â€” Dashboard station filter handling

## Project Context Summary
Owner dashboard endpoints expect `stationId` to be omitted to aggregate all stations.
However the frontend sometimes sends `stationId=all`, resulting in zero totals.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `normalizeStationId` utility to clean query parameters.
- Controllers now use this helper so values like `"all"`, `"undefined"` or `"null"` are treated as missing.
- Updated dashboard, inventory, reports, and related controllers to use the helper.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase 2 summary addition.
