# STEP_fix_20251120.md â€” Fuel price spec station id

## Project Context Summary
The prior fix exposed station names with fuel prices, but the OpenAPI specification only showed `station.name` and the controller didn't include the station relation. This caused contract drift.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `id` property to the nested `station` object in `openapi.yaml` and the complete spec.
- Updated `fuelPrice.controller.ts` to include the station relation when listing prices.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry noting spec update and controller fix.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase summary update.
