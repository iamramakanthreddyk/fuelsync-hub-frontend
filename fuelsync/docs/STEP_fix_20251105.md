# STEP_fix_20251105.md â€” Frontend guide and spec consolidation

## Project Context Summary

- Updated `frontend/docs/api-diff.md` to reference the canonical spec.
- Documented the consolidation in `PHASE_3_SUMMARY.md`.
- Logged these changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
