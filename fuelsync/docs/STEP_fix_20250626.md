# STEP_fix_20250626.md — Test DB Setup Clarification

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub's backend tests rely on automatically provisioning a `fuelsync_test` database via Jest global setup. The previous step attempted to run tests without starting PostgreSQL, causing the setup to skip tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for completed Phase 2 steps and prior fix notes up to 2025‑06‑25.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` with a reminder to start PostgreSQL via Docker script or local service before running tests.
- Noted this requirement in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` for long‑term reference.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Logged this clarification in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for tracking.
