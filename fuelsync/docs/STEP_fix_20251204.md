# STEP_fix_20251204.md â€” API service and hook consistency

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses React Query hooks to access backend services. APIs follow the `{ success, data }` response pattern with `successResponse` and `errorResponse` helpers. Previous steps ensured most hooks rely on typed API services but an inline `fetch` remained for the admin dashboard.

## What Was Done Now
- Replaced the inline `fetch` call in `useDashboard.ts` with `superadminApi.getSummary` for reuse and consistent typing.
- Updated the `/auth/test` route to use `successResponse` instead of a raw `res.json` call.
- Scanned hooks and services for hard-coded tenant or station IDs and none were found.
- Verified all controllers return responses via `successResponse`/`errorResponse`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Record this fix in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
