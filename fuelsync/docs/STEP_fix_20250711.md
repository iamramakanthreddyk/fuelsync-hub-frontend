# STEP_fix_20250711.md — SuperAdmin API Alignment

## Project Context Summary
Recent feedback showed mismatches between the frontend SuperAdmin API models and the backend responses. The backend lacked a yearly price field for plans, missing signup counts in analytics and the ability to customise tenant admin credentials. Tenant status update also used `PUT` rather than `PATCH`.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` up to the fix dated 2025‑07‑10.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `price_yearly` column via migration `005_add_price_yearly_to_plans.sql`.
- Extended plan service and admin controller to handle `priceYearly`.
- Allowed tenant creation to accept `schemaName`, `adminEmail` and `adminPassword`.
- Updated analytics summary to return fields expected by the frontend (signupsThisMonth and tenantsByPlan percentages).
- Changed tenant status route to use `PATCH`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append CHANGELOG entry describing backend alignment fixes.
- Update `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` with this fix.
- Add migration entry to `SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step.
