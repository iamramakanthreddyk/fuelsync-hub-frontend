# STEP_fix_20251201.md â€” Alert parameter naming alignment

## Project Context Summary
The backend has completed Phase 2 with dashboard metrics endpoint as the last implemented feature. Documentation uses `/api/v1/alerts/{alertId}` whereas the backend routes accept `/api/v1/alerts/{id}`. This mismatch can confuse clients and automated tooling.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Alerts controller uses `/:id` routes for delete and read operations.
- OpenAPI specifications and docs reference `{alertId}` in several places.

## What Was Built
- Updated `docs/openapi.yaml` and `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` to use `{id}` instead of `{alertId}` for alert deletion and read endpoints.
- Updated CHANGELOG and PHASE_2_SUMMARY with a new fix entry.
- Recorded this step in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.

## Files Updated
- `docs/openapi.yaml`
- `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20251201.md` (this file)

## Documentation Updates
- Added a fix entry titled "Alert parameter naming alignment" to CHANGELOG.
- Appended row in IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md and added section in PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md.
