# STEP_fix_20250706.md â€” cross-env Dependency Fix

## Project Context Summary
`npm test` failed previously because `cross-env` was not installed when only production dependencies were installed. The test script relies on `cross-env` to set `NODE_ENV`.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Database and backend phases completed with Jest-based test suite.
- Prior fix on 2025-07-05 simplified seeding scripts.

## What Was Done Now
- Moved `cross-env` from `devDependencies` to regular `dependencies` in `package.json` so that it installs in all environments.
- Updated documentation changelog, phase summary and implementation index accordingly.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` updated with this fix.
