# STEP_fix_20250716.md â€” Schema Consolidation Migration

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub originally used a schema-per-tenant design. Upcoming requirements demand a single shared schema with `tenant_id` columns. We need an idempotent migration that drops tenant schemas, recreates tables in `public`, and seeds one super admin user.

## Steps Already Implemented
All migrations and backend features up to `STEP_fix_20250715.md` are complete.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `migrations/schema/003_unified_schema.sql` to reset the database to a single `public` schema with all tenant tables including `tenant_id`.
- Created `db_brain.md` documenting the rationale, table list, relationships, and best practices for schema evolution.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append a new entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` describing the schema consolidation and documentation file.
- Update `docs/PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` with this fix.
- Add a row in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step.
