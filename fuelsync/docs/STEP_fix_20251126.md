# STEP_fix_20251126.md â€” Unified fuel inventory queries

## Project Context Summary
Fuel inventory management moved to `public.fuel_inventory` with a `tenant_id` column, but service logic still referenced per-tenant schemas.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated delivery, inventory and fuel inventory services to query `public` tables and filter by `tenant_id`.
- Removed `createFuelInventoryTable` and updated controllers to use parameterised queries.
- Controllers now pass `tenantId` as a query parameter when listing inventory.
- Documentation updated in changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append changelog entry under fixes.
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
