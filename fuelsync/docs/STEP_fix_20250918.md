# STEP_fix_20250918.md â€” Parse numeric and date fields

## Project Context Summary
Previous endpoints returned numeric and timestamp columns as strings from Postgres. Only `listSales` parsed a few fields. API consumers expect numbers and JavaScript `Date` objects.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250917.md` including numeric parsing for sales listing.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `parseDb` utility to convert string numbers and ISO date strings.
- Updated all service functions that return database rows to use this helper so numeric and date fields are properly typed.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row.
- Phase summary update.
