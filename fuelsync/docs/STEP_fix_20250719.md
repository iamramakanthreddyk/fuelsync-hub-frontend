# STEP_fix_20250719.md â€” Final Schema Adjustments

## Project Context Summary
The unified schema migration (`003_unified_schema.sql`) now holds all tenant
tables in `public`. Previous fixes added referential integrity, extra tables,
and alignment with `BUSINESS_RULES.md`. A final review requested an
`admin_activity_logs` table, `updated_at` timestamps on all tables, and
additional table comments.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Consolidated schema with `tenant_settings` and `user_stations` tables
- Added `reading_id` to `sales` and `effective_to` in `fuel_prices`
- Documented the database structure in `db_brain.md`

## What Was Done Now
- Created `admin_activity_logs` table for auditing super admin actions
- Added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column to all major tables
- Documented additional tables and timestamps in `db_brain.md`
- Added missing table comments for clarity

## Required Documentation Updates
- New entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Update `docs/PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` summarizing this fix
- Append row to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
