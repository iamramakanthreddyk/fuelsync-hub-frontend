# STEP_fix_20250624.md â€” Document test setup

## Project Context
The previous fix added a static OpenAPI spec. Local test runs were still failing because PostgreSQL was not installed and instructions were incomplete.

## What Was Done
- Added a "Run Unit Tests" section to `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` explaining how Jest provisions `fuelsync_test`.
- Linked `docs/openapi.yaml` from `README.md`.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` accordingly.
