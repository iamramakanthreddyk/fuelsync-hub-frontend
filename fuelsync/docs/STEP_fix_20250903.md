# STEP_fix_20250903.md â€” Log directory cleanup

## Project Context Summary
Runtime server logs were previously committed to the repository under `logs/server.log`.
Keeping log files in version control bloats the repository and exposes potentially sensitive information.

## Steps Already Implemented
The last fix (`STEP_fix_20250902.md`) adjusted debug middleware configuration and environment variables.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `logs/` to `.gitignore` so runtime logs aren't tracked.
- Removed `logs/server.log` from the repository and deleted the empty directory.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
