# STEP\_1\_23\_COMMAND.md ‚Äî Add `day_reconciliations` to Tenant Schema

## üß† Project Context Summary

FuelSync Hub is a multi-tenant ERP for fuel station management. Each tenant has a dedicated schema based on `tenant_schema_template.sql`. This template is being extended incrementally to support core domain workflows such as daily summaries and financial reconciliation.

This step builds upon prior additions such as `sales`, `creditors`, and `fuel_deliveries`.

## ‚úÖ Prior Steps Implemented

* `STEP_1_21_COMMAND.md`: Created initial tenant schema template.
* `STEP_1_22_COMMAND.md`: Added `creditors`, `credit_payments`, `fuel_deliveries`, `fuel_inventory` tables.

## üèóÔ∏è What to Build Now

* `database/tenant_schema_template.sql`

## üìö Docs to Update

| File                      | Update Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

## üìù Notes

* Enforce FK to `stations`
* Add `UNIQUE(station_id, date)` to prevent duplicates
* Set constraints `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`

Once this step is complete, we‚Äôll continue to finalize remaining metadata and validation structures.
