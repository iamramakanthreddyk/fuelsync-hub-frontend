# STEP_fix_20251108.md â€” Clarify update flow

## Project Context Summary

mention updating backend documentation or the final doc sync step.

- Reworded the schema changes section to stress consulting the database guide first.
- Noted this clarification in the phase 3 summary.
- Logged the fix in the changelog and implementation index.
