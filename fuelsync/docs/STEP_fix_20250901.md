# STEP_fix_20250901.md — Secure schemas route

## Project Context Summary
The `/schemas` endpoint was introduced as a development tool for quickly
listing tables or resetting demo data. When exposed in production it could
drop important tables.

## Steps Already Implemented
Latest backend updates include a catch‑all 404 handler and consistent
database password variables up to `STEP_fix_20250831.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Wrapped the `/schemas` route so it only runs in non‑production environments.
- When `NODE_ENV` is `production` the route is authenticated and simply
  returns a 403 without performing any queries.
- Documented this restriction in the OpenAPI spec and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
