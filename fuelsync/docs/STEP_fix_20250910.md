# STEP_fix_20250910.md â€” Tenant email slug generation

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub uses a unified `public` schema with tenant specific data keyed by `tenant_id`.
During tenant creation the service auto-generates Owner, Manager and Attendant
accounts. These email addresses currently use the raw tenant UUID which looks
unfriendly (`owner@951cf0fd-bc0f-471d-acea-d2238c05014f.com`).

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend services and documentation up to `STEP_fix_20250909.md` are complete
with unified schema support and working user creation.

## What Was Done Now
- Added a `slugify` helper to create URL friendly tenant slugs from the tenant name.
- Updated `createTenant` in `src/services/tenant.service.ts` to generate default
  emails using the tenant slug instead of the UUID.
- Updated user creation docs to describe the slug based email pattern.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
