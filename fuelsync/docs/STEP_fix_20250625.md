# STEP_fix_20250625.md â€” Endpoint Validation Notes

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub backend APIs are implemented (Phase 2 complete) with minimal OpenAPI documentation.
Unit tests rely on PostgreSQL but may fail if the database is unavailable.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for completed database and backend steps up to 2.13 and previous fix steps.

## What Was Done Now
- Attempted to run `npm test` to verify all CRUD endpoints.
- Test bootstrap failed because PostgreSQL was missing, so Jest skipped execution.
- Reviewed available routes against `BUSINESS_RULES.md` for missing fields or operations.
- Documented improvement notes in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` and updated `openapi.yaml`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added an "Endpoint Review" section to `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` summarising open issues.
- Expanded `/api/nozzle-readings` description in `docs/openapi.yaml`.
- Logged this fix in `CHANGELOG.md` and added a row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
