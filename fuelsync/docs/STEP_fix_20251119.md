# STEP_fix_20251119.md â€” Fuel price response station names

## Project Context Summary
Backend and frontend previously returned fuel price entries without station details. The API was updated to include the related station name for each price.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `backend_brain.md` to record that `/api/v1/fuel-prices` returns a `station` object with id and name.
- Documented the change in the changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Changelog entry under Fixes.
- Implementation index row appended.
- Phase summary updated.
