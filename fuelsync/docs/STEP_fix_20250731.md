# STEP_fix_20250731.md â€” OpenAPI Schema Detailing

## Project Context Summary
The OpenAPI specification (`docs/openapi.yaml`) listed all endpoints but most schemas were defined only as generic `type: object` without field descriptions. This made the API hard to consume without reading the source code.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Completed backend CRUD endpoints and documented them generically (up to Step 2.30).
- Maintained a complete schema reference in `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml`.

## What Was Done Now
- Replaced the minimal components section in `docs/openapi.yaml` with the detailed schemas from `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml`.
- Schemas now include property names, formats, examples and required fields for login, users, stations and other resources.
- No endpoints were changed; only the specification is now self-documenting.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under Fixes.
- Append a row to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for this fix.
- Summarise the change in `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
