# STEP_fix_20250707.md â€” Node typings for production builds

## Project Context Summary
Azure deployment failed to compile TypeScript because `tsc` couldn't find `jest` or `node` type definitions when dev dependencies were skipped. The build step installs packages in production mode.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Backend and database phases are complete with Jest-based tests.
- Previous fix on 2025-07-06 moved `cross-env` to dependencies for test scripts.

## What Was Done Now
- Moved `@types/node` from `devDependencies` to regular `dependencies` in `package.json` so that the TypeScript compiler always has Node typings.
- Removed `"jest"` from the `types` array in `tsconfig.json` since tests aren't part of the production build.
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds locally.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` updated with this fix.
