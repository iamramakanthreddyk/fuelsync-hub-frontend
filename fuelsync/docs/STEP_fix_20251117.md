# STEP_fix_20251117.md â€” Response object consistency

## Project Context Summary
Prior steps standardized the `successResponse` utility but some controllers still returned raw models. API consumers expect objects to be nested under the `data` field.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated the nozzle controller `get` and `update` handlers to call `successResponse(res, { nozzle })`.
- Verified the pump controller already used `successResponse(res, { pump })`.
- Logged this fix in the changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry under Fixes.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise fix in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
