# PHASE\_3\_SUMMARY.md — Frontend UI & Dashboard Summary

This document captures the design and progress of **Phase 3: Frontend Development** of FuelSync Hub.

Built with **Next.js 14**, **React 18**, **React Query**, and **Material UI**, the frontend supports multiple roles (SuperAdmin, Owner, Manager, Attendant) and focuses on usability, validation, and modular state handling.

---

> 🎯 After building each page or component, update its status and include links to relevant backend and OpenAPI references.

### 🖼️ Step 3.7 – Contract Mismatch Cleanup

**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `src/api/contract/readings.service.ts`, `src/hooks/useReadings.ts`, `src/api/reports.ts`, `src/hooks/useReports.ts`

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-07-13

A new file `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` captures the full API contract expected by the frontend. Differences between this specification and the backend are tracked in `frontend/docs/api-diff.md`.

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-11-05

The canonical API specification now resides in `docs/openapi.yaml`.
Refer to `FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` for the full update flow and spec link.
The older `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` is kept only for historical reference.

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-11-07

Instructions for handling new database columns moved to `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md`.
`FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` now points to that guide instead of duplicating the workflow.

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-11-08

Clarified the update flow in `FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` to include backend documentation
and the final doc sync step. The schema changes section now explicitly states that
database and backend docs are updated before the frontend adjusts.

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-11-09

`FRONTEND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` now lists a detailed schema change propagation flow starting from the database. Developers should review `DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` and `backend_brain.md` for context before updating frontend code.

### 📄 Documentation Addendum – 2025-12-03

Updated dashboard components to use `/dashboard/fuel-breakdown` and `/dashboard/sales-trend` as per latest OpenAPI.

\n### \ud83d\udcc4 Documentation Addendum – 2025-12-04\n\nRefactored admin dashboard hook to use superadmin API service and standardized auth route test response.
\n### 🖼️ Step 3.8 – Final QA Audit\n\n**Status:** ✅ Done\n**Files:** `docs/QA_AUDIT_REPORT.md`\n\n**Business Rules Covered:**\n\n* Ensure frontend and backend are fully aligned with OpenAPI.\n\n**Validation Performed:**\n\n* Reviewed endpoints, hooks and pages for completion.\n
