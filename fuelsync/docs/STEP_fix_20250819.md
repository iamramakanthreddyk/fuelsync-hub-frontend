# STEP_fix_20250819.md â€” Auth Logging Cleanup

## Project Context Summary
The authentication controller still logged extensive debug information, including a query listing all admin users. This created noise in logs after the unified schema migration.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema fixes up to `STEP_fix_20250818.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed the query retrieving all admin users from `auth.controller.ts`.
- Trimmed console statements to keep only login attempts and error logs.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
