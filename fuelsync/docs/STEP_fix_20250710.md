# STEP_fix_20250710.md â€” Dashboard & Reconciliation Bug Fixes

## Project Context Summary
The backend has comprehensive routes and controllers for FuelSync Hub. After recent API alignment, some minor issues remained: a route order causing `/daily-summary` to never match, inconsistent tenant ID retrieval in the dashboard controller, and a missing simple analytics summary for SuperAdmin users.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Full backend with authentication, reconciliation and dashboard modules.
- Prior fix on 2025-07-09 aligned all API routes under `/api/v1`.

## What Was Done Now
- Reordered routes in `reconciliation.route.ts` so `/daily-summary` resolves correctly.
- Simplified tenant detection in `getPaymentMethodBreakdown`.
- Added `getAnalytics` helper to `adminUser.controller.ts` and exposed it via `adminApi.router.ts`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this fix.
- `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` updated with bug details.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` appended with this step.
