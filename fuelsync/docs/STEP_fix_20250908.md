# STEP_fix_20250908.md â€” Admin user updated_at bug

## Project Context Summary
Creating a superadmin via `/api/v1/admin/users` returned a database error because the `updated_at` column in `admin_users` lacked a default value on some databases. Insert queries didn't provide a value, leading to a NOT NULL constraint failure.

## Steps Already Implemented
Up to `STEP_fix_20250907.md` documentation and migration scripts were clarified.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/services/admin.service.ts` and `src/services/adminUser.service.ts` to set `updated_at = NOW()` when inserting new admin users.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
