# STEP_fix_20250916.md â€” Nozzle reading service wiring

## Project Context Summary
After unifying sales storage in `STEP_fix_20250915.md`, nozzle readings should automatically create sales records. However, the `/api/v1/nozzle-readings` controller still used Prisma directly, skipping the service that inserts sales. As a result, readings were stored without generating sales rows.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250915.md`.

## What Was Done Now
- Refactored `nozzleReading.controller` to call `createNozzleReading` and `listNozzleReadings` from the service layer.
- Removed Prisma usage from the controller so readings trigger sales creation.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
