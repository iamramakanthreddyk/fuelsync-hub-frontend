# STEP_2_16_COMMAND.md — Utility Scripts & Fuel Inventory

## Project Context
Phase 2 (backend) completed with Step 2.15 covering sales listing and tenant settings.
The latest commit added several helper scripts, troubleshooting docs and a new
`/v1/fuel-inventory` endpoint, but these were never documented.

## Prior Steps Implemented
* ✅ `STEP_2_15` – Sales Listing & Settings API
* ✅ `STEP_fix_20250703` – Remove uuid-ossp defaults

## What Was Done Now
Document the newly added scripts and backend features without modifying
functionality. Update CHANGELOG, PHASE_2_SUMMARY and IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX to
include "Step 2.16".

## Files To Update
* `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
* `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
* `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
* `README.md`
