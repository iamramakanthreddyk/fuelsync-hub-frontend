# STEP_fix_20250623.md â€” Consolidated OpenAPI Documentation

## Project Context
Backend Phase 2 added a Swagger route but the repository lacked a static spec file summarizing all endpoints.

## What Was Done
- Created `docs/openapi.yaml` listing every API endpoint in OpenAPI 3.0 format.
- Referenced this file in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
- Logged the change in `CHANGELOG.md` and added a row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
