# STEP_fix_20250720.md â€” Remove Legacy DB Files

## Project Context Summary
The database has been consolidated into a single public schema with migration `003_unified_schema.sql`.
Legacy migration templates and production seed files remain in the repo and cause confusion.
Scripts also referenced an older migration path.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Unified schema migration with admin activity logs (`STEP_fix_20250719.md`)
- Documentation of schema rationale in `db_brain.md`

## What Was Done Now
- Deleted outdated files: `migrations/001_production_schema.sql`, `migrations/002_production_seed.sql`, `database/tenant_schema_template.sql`, and `sql/tenant_schema_template.sql`.
- Updated helper scripts to load `migrations/schema/001_initial_schema.sql`.
- Documented how to apply the unified schema in `db_brain.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add CHANGELOG entry for the cleanup and new instructions.
- Update `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` summarizing this fix.
- Append a row in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` referencing this step.
