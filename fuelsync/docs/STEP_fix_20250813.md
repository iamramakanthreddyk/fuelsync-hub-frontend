# STEP_fix_20250813.md â€” Response and Query Cleanups

## Project Context Summary
Recent merges introduced duplicated response objects and minor syntax issues in the credit controller and analytics service. Some raw SQL queries still used plain strings.

## Steps Already Implemented
- All backend endpoints up to Step 2.35 with unified schema.
- Enum constraint updates (`STEP_fix_20250812.md`).

## What Was Done Now
- Removed the redundant response object from `creditor.controller.ts`.
- Corrected missing semicolons and closing braces.
- Rewrote `analytics.service.ts` to build SQL using `Prisma.sql` and then execute with `$queryRaw`.
- Ensured table references use the unified `sales` name.
- Added optional `costPrice` support in `fuelPrice.validator.ts`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add fix entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Append this step to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise changes in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
