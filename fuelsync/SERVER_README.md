# FuelSync API Server

## Starting the Server

To start the server with TypeScript error checking:

```bash
npm start
```

This will first check for TypeScript errors and then start the server if no errors are found.

If you want to bypass the TypeScript check and start the server directly:

```bash
npm run start:direct
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter TypeScript errors when starting the server, fix them and try again.

Common TypeScript errors include:
- Missing type annotations for error objects in catch blocks
- Accessing properties on objects that might be undefined

## Database Setup

Before starting the server, make sure your database is properly set up:

### Quick Setup

To initialize the database with all required tables, data, and users:

```bash
npm run setup-db
```

This will run all migrations and seed the database with demo data.

### Manual Setup Steps

If you prefer to run the steps individually:

1. Check database connection:
   ```bash
   npm run check:db-connection
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate:all
   ```

 3. Seed the database:
    ```bash
    npm run db:seed
    ```

4. Check if users exist in the database:
   ```bash
   npm run check:db
   ```

## Testing

### Complete Test Suite

To run the complete test suite (database setup, seeding, and login tests):

Legacy test scripts were removed. See [docs/SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md](docs/SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md) for the
current helper commands.

### Test Users

The following test users are available:

- SuperAdmin: admin@fuelsync.dev / password
- Owner: owner@demo.com / password
- Manager: manager@demo.com / password
- Attendant: attendant@demo.com / password

Note: The tenant users (owner, manager, attendant) will be automatically matched to their tenant schema.
